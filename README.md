# Recipe App üçΩÔ∏è

This repository contains a Swift-based recipe app built using SwiftUI, developed as part of a tutorial series focused on learning advanced SwiftUI concepts. The app allows users to browse, select, and customize recipes while demonstrating the integration of various SwiftUI components and techniques.

## Features

- **Recipe Browsing**: View a collection of recipes, complete with images, descriptions, and preparation details.
- **Tab Navigation**: Navigate through the app using a clean and intuitive tab-based interface.
- **Dynamic UI with GeometryReader**: Responsive layouts and interactive elements using GeometryReader for precise control over UI components.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Load, parse, and display data from JSON files to dynamically populate the app with recipe content.
- **Portion Calculation**: Automatically adjust ingredient portions based on serving size, with an interactive Picker for easy adjustments.
- **Interactive Views**: Use swipe-able cards and custom styling to enhance user engagement with featured recipes.
- **EnvironmentObject**: Efficiently manage shared data across multiple views using the environmentObject modifier.
- **Lazy Stacks**: Improve performance with lazy-loading views using LazyVStack for long lists of ingredients and recipes.
- **Custom Styling**: Apply custom fonts and styles to ensure a cohesive and appealing design throughout the app.
